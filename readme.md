# EmulOS  

<br>
**EmulOS** is an upcoming front-end for the Raspberry Pi, focusing on computer emulators rather than games.

The ROMs will not be displayed, only the systems and their variations. The goal is to emulate as many systems as possible without worrying about the ROMs. More than just a front-end, EmulOS is a complete distro for the Raspberry Pi and a full desktop environment.

EmulOS is being developed with the Raspberry Pi 400 in mind, as its form factor is the one I find most appealing compared to computers from the 80s/90s.

## Key Features

1. **As many computers as possible**  
   Support for a wide range of computer systems, from 8-bit to modern retro machines.

2. **Emphasis only on computers, not consoles**  
   The focus is exclusively on computer emulation, not gaming consoles.

3. **Direct boot into chosen systems**  
   You can boot directly into the selected computer system, skipping menus.

4. **Complete desktop environment**  
   EmulOS is a full desktop environment where you will spend all your time, not just an application launcher.

5. **Self-updating**  
   Automatic updates to keep your system up-to-date.
