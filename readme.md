## What is it and what is it for?

EmulOS is a distro and a front-end for the Raspberry Pi, focusing on computer emulators rather than games.

The goal is to emulate as many systems as possible without worrying about the ROMs, Bios or other boring stuff. More than just a front-end, EmulOS is a complete distro for the Raspberry Pi and a minimal desktop environment.

EmulOS is being developed with the Raspberry Pi 400 in mind, as its form factor is the one I find most appealing compared to computers from the 80s/90s.

## Download .img file

The ready-to-use `.img` file, suitable for writing to an SD card and running on a Raspberry Pi 4 series, is available at the link below.  

SD card image: (https://archive.org/details/emulOS_033_img)


Use your preferred SD card writing tool for Raspberry Pi according to your operating system (such as Balena Etcher, Win32 Disk Imager, etc.).




## Manual Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the root folder of the project:
   ```bash
   cd EmulOS
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```



## File Transfer â€“ games, demos, programs, etc.

To transfer your programs, games, and other files directly to your Raspberry Pi running EmulOS, you can use SSH.  
Use your preferred file transfer tool to connect from your main PC to the Pi running EmulOS using the following credentials:

**Username:** `emulos`  
**Password:** `emulos`

These are also the default login credentials for direct access to the Raspberry Pi in case you get stuck on the Raspberry Pi OS login screen.

## About BIOS

Please note: Emulators often require BIOS files, operating system images, or other assets to function properly. Many of these files are in the public domain or originate from companies that no longer exist. However, some may still belong to existing companies or are in a legal status that is unclear.

If you opt for manual installation, you may choose to download only public domain BIOS files (even though the term "BIOS" here may also include other types of files used by older systems in emulOS), or files whose copyright status could not be clearly determined. Be aware that in most cases, you should only use full versions of these files if you own the rights or possess the original hardware.

The ready-to-use .img file includes all BIOS, operating systems, and other necessary files to run emulOS. Download it only if you meet the same conditions described above regarding full file usage.
